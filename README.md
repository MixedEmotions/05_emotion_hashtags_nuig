# Senpy Plugins

# Installing


First, install senpy from source or through pip:

    pip install senpy

Each plugin has different requirements.
As of this writing, requirement installation is done manually for each plugin.
All requirements are specified in the .senpy file and, alternatively, in a requirements.txt file.

# Running

Run with:

    git clone https://github.com/gsi-upm/senpy-plugins-community.git
    senpy -f senpy-plugins-community
